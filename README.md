# Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

During the spring of 2023, I compared the performance of various clustering algorithms (**k-means**, **DBSCAN**, and **spectral clustering**) on five different datasets.

I also compared the performance of two dimensionality reduction techniques, **PCA** and **t-SNE** on projecting the MNIST dataset in 2D space.
